### Move Like You’re Free
```
[Verse 1]
You stay quiet in the corners
Learning how to disappear
Dim the light around your edges
So nobody gets too near

But every mark you try to cover
Every tear you learned to hide
Is a chapter of your power
Written deep inside

[Pre-Chorus]
You don’t owe the world an apology
For being alive

[Chorus]
Move like you’re free
Like no one’s staring
No one deciding what you should be
Laugh like your voice was never borrowed
Love like it’s fearless, wild, and honest
We’re built from fire and endless sky
Every shape, every heart, every life
So move like you’re free
Like the world can’t cage you tonight

[Verse 2]
All those dreams you keep in whispers
They were never meant to fade
Every want that pulls you forward
Is a truth that wants its place

Let them talk, let them doubt you
Let them stay where they are
You don’t shrink to fit their comfort
You were born to spark

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ve been here through every season
Watching you rise

[Chorus]
Move like you’re free
Like no one’s staring
No one deciding what you should be
Laugh like your voice was never borrowed
Love like it’s fearless, wild, and honest
We’re built from fire and endless sky
Every shape, every heart, every life
So move like you’re free
Like the world can’t cage you tonight

[Bridge]
You don’t need permission
To shine out loud
Kindness is a quiet rebellion
That always wins somehow

[Final Chorus]
Move like you’re free
No more hiding
No more folding yourself in half
Stand in your truth, unbreakable
Let your joy hit back with grace
We’re made of dust and shooting stars
Every story matters, every scar
So move like you’re free
This moment is yours at last

[Outro]
No eyes on you
No chains on you
Just breathe
And move
