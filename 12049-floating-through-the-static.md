### Floating Through the Static
```
[Verse 1]
We’re not falling — we’re ascending
Through the static of the sky’s embrace
No gravity’s hold — just your hand
And the wind that’s never going to fade.

[Pre-Chorus]
You don’t need wings — you just need me
To lift you off the ground —
To take you beyond —
To the edge of the world —
And never come back.

[Chorus]
Floating through the static —
We’re not lost — we’re free.
No ground — no rules —
Just the sky — and you.

[Verse 2]
We’re not lost — we’re free
No compass — no map —
Just the pulse of the stars —
And the rhythm of your breath.

[Pre-Chorus]
You don’t need wings — you just need me
To lift you off the ground —
To take you beyond —
To the edge of the world —
And never come back.

[Chorus]
Floating through the static —
We’re not lost — we’re free.
No ground — no rules —
Just the sky — and you.

[Bridge]
We’re not dreaming — we’re alive
In the static — in the light —
In the silence — in the sound —
Of you — and me — and nothing else.

[Final Chorus]
Floating through the static —
We’re not lost — we’re free.
No ground — no rules —
Just the sky — and you.
