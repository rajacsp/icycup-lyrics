### Let's Experiment New
```
[Verse 1]
Last week, you turned me into something new —
Not just love, but new kind of touch.
Your hands, your breath — I didn’t know I needed this…
Until you made me want more.

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m not safe. I’m not ready to be safe —
I’m ready to break the rules…
With you. With you.

[Chorus]
New kind of touch —
New kind of me.
New kind of us.
I’m all in —
I’m all yours.
Let’s go wild —
Let’s go beyond —
Let’s go beyond
And never come back —
Unless you’re still here.

[Verse 2]
You didn’t just kiss me —
You reprogrammed my body.
I didn’t know I could feel this…
Until you made me want more.

[Pre-Chorus]
Let’s try different —
Not just “this” —
Not just “that” —
But new.
New angles. New rhythm. New fire.

[Chorus]
New kind of touch —
New kind of me.
New kind of us.
I’m all in —
I’m all yours.
Let’s go wild —
Let’s go beyond —
Let’s go beyond
And never come back —
Unless you’re still here.

[Bridge]
You’re my secret…
My surrender…
My experiment.
I don’t want to be known —
I want to be unmade —
By you.

[Final Chorus]
New kind of touch —
New kind of me.
New kind of us.
I’m all in —
I’m all yours.
Let’s go wild —
Let’s go beyond —
Let’s go beyond
And never come back —
Unless you’re still here.
