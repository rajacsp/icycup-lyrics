### Title: Roll With the Motion
#### Voice: Male
```
[Intro]
Where we at now?
Yeah—
Let’s go

[Chorus]
If you wanna roll and feel the night with me
Windows down, city shining underneath
Tell me why this life feels so unreal
(Yeah—must be the grind)
If you wanna lose track of time with me
Backseat laughs, music on repeat
Tell me why this moment feels so right
(Yeah—must be the grind)

[Verse 1]
Late-night glow, everything aligned
Scanning the room, I’m reading the signs
Looking for a spark, something genuine
Someone who can match this momentum

I see you move like you know the beat
Confidence loud, but you move discreet
Caught your smile from across the floor
Now you’re walking straight toward me

You said you like the way I stay composed
Like the way I turned dreams into roads
Like the shine when the streetlights hit
And how I carry every win and miss

[Chorus]
If you wanna roll and feel the night with me
Windows down, city shining underneath
Tell me why this life feels so unreal
(Yeah—must be the grind)
If you wanna lose track of time with me
Backseat laughs, music on repeat
Tell me why this moment feels so right
(Yeah—must be the grind)

[Verse 2]
Came a long way from checking receipts
Now it’s tap-to-pay, no second-guessing me
Haters stuck outside the frame
While I switch lanes and elevate

Feels strange turning thoughts into pay
Using my mind instead of running away
Name on the title, keys in my palm
I built this life calm by calm

Phone buzzing—another city calling
Another show, another night installing
Same ones who laughed now asking favors
I smile and keep it moving, no explanations

[Chorus]
If you wanna roll and feel the night with me
Windows down, city shining underneath
Tell me why this life feels so unreal
(Yeah—must be the grind)
If you wanna lose track of time with me
Backseat laughs, music on repeat
Tell me why this moment feels so right
(Yeah—must be the grind)

[Bridge]
They didn’t see it when it was just a vision
Only showed up when it turned official
Now they want passes, now they want seats
But I remember every closed door vividly

This isn’t luck, this isn’t chance
It’s pressure, patience, taking the stance
If you’re here now, you earned the view
So come ride—this lane’s for you

[Final Chorus]
If you wanna roll and feel the night with me
City breathing like it believes in me
Tell me why this life feels so unreal
(Yeah—must be the grind)
If you wanna stay in the moment with me
No rewind, just energy
Tell me why it all feels right
(Yeah—must be the grind)

[Outro]
Yeah—roll with the motion
Yeah—this is the moment
Must be the grind
