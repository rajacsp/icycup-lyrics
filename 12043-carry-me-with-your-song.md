### Carry Me With Your Song
```
[Verse 1]
Some nights I drift into old memories
Lose track of hours, lose track of sleep
I think of someone I knew long ago
Back when the world moved soft and slow

Your voice was a place I could disappear
Like home whenever life felt unclear
But now you’re living beyond my days
And I’m still standing miles away

[Pre-Chorus]
If I close my eyes just right
I almost feel you near

[Chorus]
Carry me with your song tonight
Let it lift me out of time
When the distance feels too strong
Carry me with your song
Carry me with your song

[Verse 2]
When I look at my reflection now
I see who I was and who I am
Every line tells a different year
Every silence still brings you here

If I sang your name into the dark
Would it echo where you are?
Would the sound survive the years
And stay with us forever?

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m far from where my heart began
But I know the way back

[Chorus]
Carry me with your song tonight
Let it lift me out of time
When the distance feels too strong
Carry me with your song
Carry me with your song

[Bridge]
I don’t need the world to change
I just need to feel that sound
Something gentle, something true
Pulling me back around

[Final Chorus]
Carry me with your song tonight
Let it cross the years and lines
If I can’t be where you are
Carry me with your song
Carry me with your song

[Outro]
I’ll find my way back someday
Till then—
Carry me
