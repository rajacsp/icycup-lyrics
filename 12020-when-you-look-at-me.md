### Title: When You Look at Me
```
[Verse 1]
Soft lights breathing on the water
The night moves at its own pace
Something unseen pulls me closer
I don’t fight it, I just wait

You’re sitting where the moment pauses
Like the space was left for me
I don’t know how to cross the distance
But the silence feels like an invitation

[Pre-Chorus]
I carry more than I can say
And less courage than I need

[Chorus]
What do I do when you’re this near?
When every thought disappears
What do I say when your eyes stay on me
And I forget how to breathe?
Your calm meets my nervous smile
I don’t know where to place my hands
When you look at me like that

[Verse 2]
Time stretches, then collapses
Everything moves and stands still
You’re the only constant in the room
And I don’t pretend you’re not

I rehearse words I never speak
Let my heart do all the talking
If you asked me to stay awhile
I don’t think I’d think at all

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m louder inside my chest
Than I’ve ever been out loud

[Chorus]
What do I do when you’re this near?
When every thought disappears
What do I say when your eyes stay on me
And I forget how to breathe?
Your calm meets my nervous smile
I don’t know where to place my hands
When you look at me like that

[Bridge]
I don’t need fireworks or noise
Just this quiet, just this space
If I sit beside you now
Maybe that’s enough to say

[Final Chorus]
What do I do when you’re this near?
When the world feels thin and clear
What do I say when your eyes stay on me
And I lose myself right there?
If I’m blushing, let it show
If I’m nervous, let it stay
I don’t need to understand
When you look at me like that

[Outro]
Just stay
Right here
That’s all
