### Catch Me in the Noise
#### Voice: Female
```
[Intro]
Hey—
Yeah
Ooooh

[Verse 1]
I’m the quiet type, back of the room
Watching moments pass me through
Always waiting, always still
But tonight I’ve changed my rules

Something in the way you look
Pulled me out of my disguise
I feel brave for no good reason
Like trouble learned to smile

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ve been hiding in plain sight
But my pulse won’t play along
If I’m gonna take a chance
Might as well be now

[Chorus]
Ready or not, I’m stepping in
City lights, adrenaline
Crowds are moving, bass is loud
But I’ll spot you somehow
Ready or not, I’m coming close
Read my lips, don’t need to know
If you hear me sing it out
Follow the sound—
Ready or not

[Verse 2]
Hi—no script, just say my name
Feels like we’ve met in another frame
You look familiar in a déjà vu way
Like I’ve known you yesterday

We don’t need castles or magazine dreams
Just one night that feels like a scene
If you’re leaving, take me with you
I’m lighter than I seem

[Pre-Chorus]
Strike a spark, don’t overthink
Let the moment drive
If this is where the story bends
I’m not gonna fight it

[Chorus]
Ready or not, I’m stepping in
City lights, adrenaline
Crowds are moving, bass is loud
But I’ll spot you somehow
Ready or not, I’m coming close
Read my lips, don’t need to know
If you hear me sing it out
Follow the sound—
Ready or not

[Bridge]
You’re a breath I didn’t know I needed
Filling up my empty lungs
Spin with me till morning breaks
Like the night has just begun

No escape, no hide-and-seek
I’m done pretending I don’t feel
If I’m jumping, I’m jumping deep
This is real

[Final Chorus]
Ready or not, here I am
Heart out loud, no backup plan
Every face is fading now
But yours is clear somehow
Ready or not, say it back
Say you’re in, don’t hold it back
If you hear me calling out
Follow the sound—
Ready or not

[Outro]
Ready or not
I showed up
Ready or not
