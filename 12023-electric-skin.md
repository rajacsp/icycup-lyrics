### Electric Skin
```
[Verse 1]
I’ve got your number, burning in my chest,
Counting breaths ’til I can say your name.
When the world turns gray, we’re the only light—
We rise like static, wild and unafraid.

[Pre-Chorus]
No map, no plan — just a pulse in our veins.
We dance in the dark like we’re never gonna leave.

[Chorus]
Are you feeling it?
That electric skin?
It’s humming through your bones,
When you look at me —
It’s coming true.
I can feel it —
The rhythm in your chest,
The way your fingers tremble…
I can feel it —
When you’re breathing with me.

[Verse 2]
We’re hiding under bleachers, bottles in our hands,
But we’re not hiding — we’re alive in the storm.
No need for stars — the sky’s our stage,
We’ll never let the night go quiet again.

[Pre-Chorus]
Don’t wake me if I’m dreaming —
I’ll stay here all night,
And you’ll be the reason I never wake up.

[Chorus]
Are you feeling it?
That electric skin?
It’s humming through your bones,
When you look at me —
It’s coming true.
I can feel it —
The rhythm in your chest,
The way your fingers tremble…
I can feel it —
When you’re breathing with me.

[Bridge]
We’re not lost — we’re just too wild to be found.
No fortune teller — we’re the ones who choose the sound.

[Final Chorus]
Are you feeling it?
That electric skin?
It’s humming through your bones,
When you look at me —
It’s coming true.
I can feel it —
The rhythm in your chest,
The way your fingers tremble…
I can feel it —
When you’re breathing with me.

[Outro — Whispered]
(Oh… oh… oh… oh…)
We’re not waiting —
We’re alive.
We’re electric.
We’re skin to skin.
We’re… never letting go.
