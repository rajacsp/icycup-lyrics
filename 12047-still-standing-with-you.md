### Still Standing With You
```
[Verse 1]

The world’s on fire, they say, and I’m lost inside
They scream in the dark — things I can’t let go
But I don’t need them — I don’t need to fight
‘Cause you’re the anchor, and I’m still standing right.

[Pre-Chorus]
They’ll try to drown me — or tear me down
But I’m not falling — I’m rising with you

[Chorus]
I don’t mind —
‘Cause I’m still standing with you
I don’t mind —
‘Cause I’m still standing with you
Love — love — love —
Love — love — love —
Still standing with you

[Verse 2]
They try to crush me — they try to make me break
Say I’m not enough — but you’re the one who says
“Hey, you’re not lost — you’re just standing tall”
And that’s the truth — even when the world turns cold

[Pre-Chorus]
They’ll push me down — but I’ll rise again
You’re the light — and I’m still here —
You’re the one who turns my pain to flame

[Chorus]
I don’t mind —
‘Cause I’m still standing with you
I don’t mind —
‘Cause I’m still standing with you
Love — love — love —
Love — love — love —
Still standing with you

[Bridge]
Even if the sky turns black —
Even if the ground turns to dust —
I’ll still be here —
With you —
Still standing —
Still standing —
Still standing —
With you.

[Final Chorus]
I don’t mind —
‘Cause I’m still standing with you
I don’t mind —
‘Cause I’m still standing with you
Love — love — love —
Love — love — love —
Still standing with you

[Outro — Whispered]
Still…
Still…
Still…
Still…
Still standing…
With you.
