### Keys on the Counter
```
[Verse 1]
Leave the cologne, leave the shine
Take your noise and your wasted time
Pull that ego out of my drive
This space is mine—consider it closed

You came in loud, you stayed too long
Thought my patience meant I was wrong
Pack your charm, it’s lost its use
I’m done explaining the obvious

[Pre-Chorus]
You call it madness
I call it clarity

[Chorus]
Say I’m reckless, say I’ve changed
If this is wild, you lit the flame
I don’t owe you a single tear
You’re not staying—make it clear
If drawing lines makes me “untrue”
Then I learned it from dealing with you
Call me whatever helps you sleep
You’re not welcome in my peace

[Verse 2]
I don’t collect your drama calls
Or play referee to your stalls
You thought the games would bend the rules
Funny how they end with you

I don’t argue with déjà vu
I don’t repeat what I already knew
If respect feels hard to give
Find another room to live

[Pre-Chorus]
I see straight through
Your “almost sorry”

[Chorus]
Say I’m reckless, say I’ve changed
If this is wild, you lit the flame
I don’t owe you a single tear
You’re not staying—make it clear
If drawing lines makes me “untrue”
Then I learned it from dealing with you
Call me whatever helps you sleep
You’re not welcome in my peace

[Bridge]
I’ve got sense and a backbone too
I won’t shrink to make space for you
Thought I’d fold when you raised your voice
I made a better choice

Don’t look surprised, don’t take it personal
I’m just allergic to disrespect now

[Break / Chant]
Not my habit
Not my scene
Take your mess
Leave my dreams

[Final Chorus]
Say I’m reckless, say I’ve changed
If this is wild, you lit the flame
I don’t owe you a single tear
You’re not staying—make it clear
If choosing me offends your pride
I’ll wear that truth and sleep just fine
Call me whatever helps you sleep
You’re not welcome in my peace

[Outro]
Keys on the counter
Door behind you
I’m done explaining
Goodnight
