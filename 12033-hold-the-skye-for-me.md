### Hold the Sky for Me
```
[Verse 1]
Morning breaks over unfamiliar streets
Soft as a promise we still believe
Every shade finds its way to light
Like our shadows learning how to align

I know the road bends without warning
But we’re still standing here
If the weight starts leaning heavy
Stay close—don’t disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
When the noise gets louder
And the ground feels far below

[Chorus]
Hold the sky for me when the night comes down
Pull me closer when I lose my balance now
Give me something real when the stars go dim
I’ll be right here, steadying you again
Catch my breath when the lights fade slow
Bring me back when I’m too high to know
Give me love and I’ll give it back
I’m yours through every after-dark

[Verse 2]
Time keeps moving in changing colors
Nothing stays, but we still do
Every season writes a new chapter
Still ends with me choosing you

I won’t pretend I’m always fearless
I won’t say I never fall
But if you reach when I’m drifting
I’ll answer every call

[Pre-Chorus]
When the air gets thinner
And the silence starts to grow

[Chorus]
Hold the sky for me when the night comes down
Pull me closer when I lose my balance now
Give me something real when the stars go dim
I’ll be right here, steadying you again
Catch my breath when the lights fade slow
Bring me back when I’m too high to know
Give me love and I’ll give it back
I’m yours through every after-dark

[Bridge]
We don’t know where the road will end
Or what these moments might become
But if the world feels unfamiliar
We’ll face it as one

[Final Chorus]
Hold the sky for me when the night comes down
Pull me closer when I lose my balance now
Give me something real when the stars go dim
I’ll be right here, steadying you again
Catch my breath when the lights fade slow
Bring me back when I’m too high to know
Give me love and I’ll give it back
I’m yours—forever after-dark

[Outro]
When the morning comes
We rise again
