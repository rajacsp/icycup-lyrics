### Just Be Real
```
[Verse 1]
Slow down, why you raising your voice?
Take a breath, this isn’t a choice
You don’t have to prove anything
If you’d just stay still, you’d see

I like you when it’s quiet late
Windows down, no audience
When it’s just us, you don’t pretend
But then the crowd walks in and—

[Pre-Chorus]
You shift your tone
Change your face
Like being yourself
Isn’t safe

[Chorus]
Why you twisting every moment?
Why you turning simple into hard?
I see you playing someone stronger
But it pulls us further apart
Life isn’t clean, it bends, it breaks
You fall, you learn, you re-create
You told me I’d never have to guess
If what you show is what you meant
So why not just be real with me?

[Verse 2]
You show up dressed like you’re on display
Like you rehearsed every word you’d say
I laugh because I know the truth
This version doesn’t look like you

Drop the act, lose the disguise
You’re not fooling anyone inside
You don’t need armor to belong
I liked you better before it all went wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
You watch your step
Scan the room
Trying so hard
You forget who’s you

[Chorus]
Why you twisting every moment?
Why you turning simple into hard?
I see you playing someone stronger
But it pulls us further apart
Life isn’t clean, it bends, it breaks
You fall, you learn, you re-create
You told me I’d never have to guess
If what you show is what you meant
So why not just be real with me?

[Bridge]
You don’t need a second skin
Or a script to fit right in
If you’d just let the noise fade out
You’d remember what this was about

[Final Chorus]
Why you twisting every moment?
Why you hiding who you are?
I don’t need the polished version
I need you without the guard
Life’s messy, that’s how it goes
You stumble, stand, and then you grow
I don’t want perfect, I want true
The only thing I asked of you
Was just be real with me

[Outro]
Yeah—
Life’s not simple
But you don’t have to make it harder
