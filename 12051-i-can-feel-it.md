### I Can Feel It (Digital Flame)
```
[Verse 1]

I got your number, don’t ask me why
I’ve been waiting since the dawn of the day
When the lights go out, we don’t need a map
We’ll find each other in the dark, no need to ask
We go where we go, we do what we want
No rules, no chains, no “maybe” or “no”
We’ll be the color in all this black and white
And you’re the only thing that matters to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you feeling what I’m feeling?
Cause it’s really, really right
Don’t wake me if dreaming
I could stay here all night
I can feel it —
I can feel it —
I can feel it coming true
I can feel it —
I can feel it —
When I’m looking at you

[Chorus]
I can feel it, yeah, I can feel it
When I’m looking at you —
I can feel it, yeah, I can feel it
In the way you smile —
I can feel it, yeah, I can feel it
You’re my rhythm, my soul, my light
I can feel it —
I can feel it —
When you’re breathing with me

[Verse 2]
Head’s spinning, but I don’t care
No fortune teller, just the truth in my heart
We’re hiding from the light —
Kicking bottles under bleachers
But we’re dancing in the dark, no shame
We’re the only ones who know how to be brave
Say you’ll remember — “Forever Young”
We’ll make it real — we’ll make it true

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you feeling what I’m feeling?
Cause I’m really, really fine
Don’t wake me if dreaming
I could stay here all night
I can feel it —
I can feel it —
I can feel it coming true
I can feel it —
I can feel it —
When I’m looking at you

[Chorus]
I can feel it, yeah, I can feel it
When I’m looking at you —
I can feel it, yeah, I can feel it
In the way you move —
I can feel it, yeah, I can feel it
You’re my rhythm, my soul, my light
I can feel it —
I can feel it —
When you’re breathing with me

[Bridge]
We don’t need the stars, we don’t need the moon
Just your voice, your touch, your heartbeat’s true
I’ll be here, I’ll be here, I’ll be here
Even if the world turns to dust
We’ll be the color in all this black and white
And you’re the only thing that matters to me

[Final Chorus – Big Build]
I can feel it —
I can feel it —
I can feel it coming true
I can feel it —
I can feel it —
When I’m looking at you
I can feel it —
I can feel it —
I can feel it —
I can feel it —
I can feel it —
When you’re breathing with me

[Outro – Whispered, fading]
...I can feel it...
...I can feel it...
...I can feel it...
...I can feel it...
...I can feel it...
...I can feel it...
...I can feel it...
...I can feel it...
