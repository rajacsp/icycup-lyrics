### Still Soft, Still Standing
```
[Verse 1]
Stay right here for a second longer
If this is fading, don’t rush the truth
Let me hold onto the feeling
Before I remember what I knew

One last laugh in borrowed time
One last look before we break
I know this moment isn’t forever
But I’m not ready to wake

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanted real, I wanted honest
Even if it left a scar

[Chorus]
I wanted what I wanted
And it cost me part of my heart
Yeah, I’m shaken, yeah, I’m hurting
But I know I’ll make a start
It was love, it wasn’t painless
But it taught me who I am
I’m not falling apart forever
I’m just bruised where I once stood

[Verse 2]
I got lost in the way you promised
Said the right things at the wrong time
I ignored the quiet warnings
That were drawing all the lines

For a moment, I believed
You saw the best in me
Now I see it clearer
What I needed wasn’t you—it was me

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m scared, but I can feel it
Something better’s on its way

[Chorus]
I wanted what I wanted
And it cost me part of my heart
Yeah, I’m shaken, yeah, I’m hurting
But I know I’ll make a start
It was love, it wasn’t painless
But it taught me who I am
I’m not falling apart forever
I’m just bruised where I once stood

[Bridge]
I stayed quiet to keep the peace
While my heart was screaming loud
You didn’t hear me breaking
So I’m listening to myself now

I don’t regret the loving
I regret staying too long

[Final Chorus]
I wanted what I wanted
And I paid the price in tears
But I’m stronger than the moment
That tried to trap me here
It was love, and love can hurt you
Before it lets you grow
I’m not broken, I’m not finished
I’m just learning how to let go

[Outro]
Still soft
Still breathing
Still standing
